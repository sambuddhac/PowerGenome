    There is an issue with assigning regional cost multipliers. In your settings file
    under the parameter 'cost_multiplier_technology_map`, the EIA technology 'CC - multi shaft'
    has an ATB technology 'NETL_NGCC'. This ATB name matches more than one new ATB tech
    listed in the settings parameter 'atb_new_gen'. Only the first matching tech in
    'atb_new_gen' will get a valid regional cost multiplier; the rest will have values of
    0, which will lead to annual investment costs of $0.

    There is an issue with assigning regional cost multipliers. In your settings file
    under the parameter 'cost_multiplier_technology_map`, the EIA technology 'CC - multi shaft'
    has an ATB technology 'NETL_NGCC'. This ATB name matches more than one new ATB tech
    listed in the settings parameter 'atb_new_gen'. Only the first matching tech in
    'atb_new_gen' will get a valid regional cost multiplier; the rest will have values of
    0, which will lead to annual investment costs of $0.

    There is an issue with assigning regional cost multipliers. In your settings file
    under the parameter 'cost_multiplier_technology_map`, the EIA technology 'CC - multi shaft'
    has an ATB technology 'NETL_NGCC'. This ATB name matches more than one new ATB tech
    listed in the settings parameter 'atb_new_gen'. Only the first matching tech in
    'atb_new_gen' will get a valid regional cost multiplier; the rest will have values of
    0, which will lead to annual investment costs of $0.
